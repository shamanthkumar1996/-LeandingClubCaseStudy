## General Information
- This is a EDA project where we are dealing with data from a lending organization which has various parameters.
- The Data is from a consumer finanace company where we have close to 40000 borrowers and on basis of this data we have to form insights.
- Based on the analysis and insights we have to decide whether to approve the loan or not.
- We are using loan.csv dataset which has more than 100 columns and 40000 rows.

## Conclusions
- Based on the analysis done via various techniques: Univariate anyalysis, Bivariate analysis we came to conclusion that interest rate,annual_inc, addr_state, grade, term, loan_amnt purpose are important factors for deciding on set borrowers who defaulting on loan payment.
- Term: duration of the loan ( lesser the duration lower the chances of defaulters)Â¶
- Interest rate (lesser the interest rate higher the chances of loan repayment)
-  Purpose for which the loan is availed- debt_consolidation,credit_card, home_improvement and small_business are major categories where loss is more.
- addr_state: Few states like CA (California) and FL (Florida) has high loan defaulters
- Grades: Loan grade A, B have higher chances of repayment and C,D,E,F,G grades have maximum defaulters.
- annual_inc --> annual income (higher the income higher the chances of repayment)
- loan_amnt: Higher the loan higher the chances of loan default.
